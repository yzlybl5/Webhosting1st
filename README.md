## Webhosting1st Introduction

Webhosting1st started back in 2011 with a simple mission: provide reliable web hosting that doesn't drain your wallet. They're based in Poland and run their own servers using Tier III colocation, which basically means your website sits on quality infrastructure that's built to stay online.

Here's what makes them different: they use pure NVMe SSD storage across all plans (the fast stuff), offer RAID 10 disk arrays for data protection, and throw in unlimited domains, email accounts, and MySQL databases regardless of which plan you pick. They've also got DirectAdmin as their control panel—not as flashy as cPanel, but it gets the job done without the premium price tag.

The company operates with a 99.9% uptime guarantee and provides 24/7 support. They accept PayPal, credit cards, and even Bitcoin if that's your thing. Plus, there's a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can test the waters without much risk.

## Webhosting1st Promo Codes

As of January 2026, Webhosting1st doesn't frequently run promotional coupon codes. Unlike some hosting companies that bombard you with discount codes every week, Webhosting1st keeps it simple—their prices are already pretty low year-round.

That said, here's what we know:

- **Occasional discounts**: The company has offered up to 30% off on shared hosting plans during special promotions
- **No code needed**: Most deals are automatically applied at checkout
- **Direct pricing**: What you see on their website is typically what you pay—no hidden fees or surprise renewal increases

The best strategy? Their standard prices are competitive enough that you're getting a good deal without needing to hunt for codes. But it's worth checking their homepage or contacting their sales team before ordering, as they sometimes run quiet promotions that aren't heavily advertised.

The general theme? Webhosting1st delivers reliable, fast hosting at budget-friendly prices. It's not flashy, and it's not trying to be everything to everyone. But for small businesses, bloggers, and developers who want solid hosting without the premium price tag, it consistently hits the mark.

**Final Thoughts**

Webhosting1st isn't going to wow you with marketing hype or flashy dashboards. What they will do is give you reliable, fast hosting at prices that actually make sense. Their server infrastructure is solid (Tier III colocation, NVMe SSDs, RAID 10), their features are generous (unlimited domains and databases), and their prices are genuinely affordable—not just "affordable for the first year then triple on renewal" affordable.

If you're launching a new blog, running a small business site, or managing client websites on a budget, Webhosting1st deserves a look. They've been doing this since 2011, and they're still here because they focus on the basics that matter: uptime, speed, and support.
